RPAN Media Player v1.4
By Leslie E. Krause

RPAN Media Player is a Windows application that makes it possible to watch RPAN videos 
alongside a synchronized chat replay. 

The package consists of the following files:

  /rpan_media_player
  |- README.txt
  |- LICENSE.txt
  |- player.hta
  |- /lib
     |- chatreplay.js
     |- videoplayer.js
     |- format.js

The required chat archives can be generated by the RPAN Chat Archive Wizard:

  https://www.globalstationtuner.org/rpan/chat_archive_wizard.html

Be sure to download all chatlogs as '.json', then move them into the same folder as the
associated RPAN videos. Each '.json' file should correspond with an '.mp4' file:

  31-Oct-2022_Halloween_Party.mp4
  31-Oct-2022_Halloween_Party.json
  24-Oct-2022_Playing_New_Games.mp4
  24-Oct-2022_Playing_New_Games.json

To run the RPAN Media Player, simply double-click on the 'player.hta' executable. Then
select the video you want to watch. Click '>' to start playback. The comments will start
to appear in sync with the video. You can scan backward or forward through the video by
clicking '<<' or '>>', or jump to a specific time using the seek bar at the bottom.
